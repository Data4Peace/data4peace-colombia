## Contents
This directory contains the original (raw) dataset files that were downloaded, scraped, pulled, etc. to compile for the Data4Peace conference. The directory is composed of 5 subdirectories that reflect the 4 "temas" (themes) of the conference + a directory for more general variables (e.g. socioeconomic, demographics).

The four conference themes (and the accompanying directories) are:
  1. ddr = Demobilization, Disarmament, and Reintegration (DDR) and Reconciliation
  2. localdev = Local Development
  3. participation = Political Participation
  4. socioecon = Socioeconomic

### 1) /ddr

### 2) /localdev

### 3) /participation

### 4) /socioecon
